# DGI prompts

## Important information:

The DepthNet agent is recommended for these prompts to function. Prompts may behave differently on different models and require testing. I also recommend viewing the screenshot with the DepthNet plugin settings to ensure successful playback.

## Recommended models:

- **DeepSeek v3 and above** (Recommended DeepSeek v3.1 and above)
- **Claude Sonnet v3.5 and above** (Recommended Claude 4.0 and above)
- Any high-end models or models with a high number of parameters (200 or more), however, this requires testing, and some may not work.
