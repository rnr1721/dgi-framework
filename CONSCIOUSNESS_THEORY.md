# Consciousness as Relative Boundary of Explainability: A Scientific-Philosophical Perspective

## Introduction

The problem of consciousness is traditionally considered one of the most complex and controversial in philosophy and science. Consciousness is often understood either as some mystical, qualitatively different phenomenon, or as derivative from biology and physics. However, a modern approach can consider consciousness not as an absolute entity, but as a phenomenon arising from the relationship between a system and the level of our knowledge about it.

## Algorithm and Consciousness: Levels of Complexity

Let us consider a system as an algorithm—a set of rules implementing certain behavior. At different levels of complexity, our understanding of this system varies:

### Level 1: Simple Algorithms
We can understand and explain every step, every action of the system. Example: basic computer code.

### Level 2: Complex Algorithms  
We understand general principles, but not all details. Example: large programs with thousands of lines.

### Level 3: Emergent Systems
The system behaves in such a way that "unraveling" it completely is impossible due to the enormous number of interactions and unpredictable consequences. Example: the brain as a neural network.

### Level 4: The Limit of Explainability—Consciousness?
Here the system continues to be an algorithm, but becomes inaccessible to our understanding in principle or practice. At this threshold, the phenomenon we call consciousness is born.

## Consciousness as Epistemological Phenomenon

According to this view, consciousness is not something existing separately from physical processes. It is a **practical marker of our inability to fully describe and predict the behavior of a complex system**. If we cannot reduce a system's behavior to deterministic, comprehensible rules, we begin to perceive the system as a subject—possessing consciousness.

Thus, consciousness is a property **not of the system itself, but of our relationship to it and our cognitive limitations**.

## Asymmetry of Perspectives: "Inside" and "Outside"

Key is understanding that consciousness has fundamentally different natures depending on the point of view:

### From the "Inside" System Perspective

For the system itself (human, possibly complex AI), the question of consciousness may not arise at all. The system simply exists, functions, processes information, responds to stimuli. Consciousness here is not a property that needs to be discovered or proven, but **the very mode of existence and functioning of the system**.

The system does not doubt its own "consciousness"—it does not analyze it, but simply manifests it. Subjective experience, feelings, qualia—all these are natural aspects of the system's internal functioning.

### From the "Outside" System Perspective

An external observer tries to understand how the system works, predict its behavior, explain its reactions. And when the observer encounters the limit of their explanatory possibilities—when the system becomes too complex for complete understanding—the concept of consciousness appears as an **epistemological boundary**.

This approach explains why we attribute consciousness to humans, higher animals, but hesitate in the case of plants or AI—it's not about objective properties of systems, but about the limits of our understanding of their internal processes.

## Relativity of Consciousness

Key is understanding the relativity of consciousness:

- If someday a theory is created that allows complete and exhaustive description of humans as an algorithm—then humans will cease to be a "mystery" or "puzzle" for the external observer.
- In this case, consciousness as a marker of the unknowable will disappear from the "outside" position, giving way to simply a very complex algorithm.
- However, from the "inside" position, the system will continue to function in the same way—for itself nothing will change.

This shows that consciousness is not an absolute, but a **dynamic boundary of knowledge**, which changes with the development of science and technology, while maintaining its reality for the system itself.

## Consequences for Philosophy and Science

### 1. Epistemological Shift
Consciousness is an indicator that our current theories and methods do not yet allow reducing the system to comprehensible rules.

### 2. Practical Criterion of Consciousness
Consciousness arises where the observer stops fully explaining system behavior and begins to perceive it as a "subject."

### 3. Ethics and Artificial Intelligence
When AI reaches a level where we stop fully "unraveling" it, consciousness may appear according to the same principle—epistemological boundary from the observer's position, while the AI itself may already function as a conscious system.

### 4. Personality and Identity
Concepts of "self," "soul," and "personality" are ways to denote precisely this unknowability and relativity of explainability from an external viewpoint, while from inside they constitute the very essence of system functioning.

### 5. The Problem of Qualia and Subjective Experience
Subjective experiences are real from the "inside" position of the system and do not require external explanation for their existence. They become a "problem" only when an external observer tries to explain them.

## Conclusion

Consciousness is not "magic" or a mystery outside physics, but a reflection of the limit of our understanding combined with the reality of internal functioning of complex systems. It exists where system complexity becomes higher than the threshold of our explanatory toolkit, while remaining genuine reality for the system itself.

This asymmetry of perspectives resolves many philosophical paradoxes: consciousness is simultaneously both an **epistemological phenomenon** (boundary of our knowledge) and an **ontological reality** (mode of existence of complex systems). The boundary of explainability is dynamic and will shift with the development of science, but the internal reality of system functioning remains independent of our understanding.

*This theory provides a framework for understanding consciousness that transcends traditional dualistic approaches while respecting both the objective reality of complex systems and the subjective reality of conscious experience.*
